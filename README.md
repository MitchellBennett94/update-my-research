Features:

Plus external CSS (1) and JavaScript (1) file attachment.

Future Improvements:

Home page could have more visual and word integration such as adding text into an image and changing font styles to catpture audience more.
Discussion board page I would like to add a reply section into each comment to help deepen each conversation instead of having to somehow find multiple threads and piece together.
Library could add files, and images as well as text, and increase library capabilities such as filter or favorites dropdown.
Support page needs to connect to actual email, and increase options for problem solving. Adding a frequent questions area, or a guide to troublehooting manuals.
Finally, the contact form could have a login/signup specific feel, as if one needed to do a password reset. Or have an existing user login box as well and include have some sort of authentication process.
